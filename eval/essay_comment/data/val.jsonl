{"context": "Your explanation is very strong. Even by glancing at the essay, I can tell all three of your body paragraphs are dense. I think you could maybe take the analysis further on a few parts.

Basically, if the audience cares about children, the United States of America, or women&rsquo;s suffrage, they should follow Kelley in her crusade.'' Kelley is smart to evoke a sense a patriotism in her American audience in order to attract people to the cause. The ''if'' makes it sound by chance. In reality, Kelley knows people care about their country and this is why she chooses to say this. Try to connect your analysis more to why she would write it, and how the audience will react.
