For men, it serves to show that all women are against child labor, and they also should fight against it.''

{"context": "There are a few lapses in grammar. For example, in your sentence ''By connecting to his audience emotionally, Louv involves them with the issue, makes them recognize...'' (paragraph 4) the ''them'' should be ''it'', because an audience is singular. In paragraph 5, there are shifts in tense, from present (''Louv worries'') to past (''he has appealed''). You can easily replace ''he has appealed'' to simply ''appeals''. On the whole, these mistakes are trivial and do not obstruct understanding the essay. At times, your prose becomes colloquial or contrasts sharply with your overall sophisticated diction. For example, ''To hammer in his final point...'' (paragraph 4) sounds clunky and informal. In paragraph 2, you do not need to define what an anecdote is.", "target": "With Explanation", "others": {"dimension": "language", "com_no": 8104}}
