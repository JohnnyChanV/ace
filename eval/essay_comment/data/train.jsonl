So, although the identification of devices is correct, their application to Louv's purpose is often not that clear.  This could be solved by providing better commentary and analysis of the devices.

The author is missing the word ''but'' in between ''hours'' and ''she'', and the phrase ''children are not treated unfairly'' should be changed to ''children are treated fairly'' as it is an awkward double negative. In addition, the author occasionally uses contractions, which could have been changed with simple proofreading: ''...the subjects of terrible abuse due to the harmful conditions where they'd work and the relentless hours of labor expected of them''.
